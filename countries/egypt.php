        Rizal disembarked and went sightseeing, and was most impressed by the beautiful moonlight, which reminded him of Calamba and his family.

     Rizal landed in Port Said, the Mediterranean terminal of the Suez Canal, to see the interesting sights. He was fascinated by the multi-racial inhabitants, speaking a babel of tongues like Arabic, Egyptian, Greek, French, Italian, Spanish, etc.
