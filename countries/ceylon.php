Rizal found the Djemnah larger and cleaner, which carried more passengers; they were British, French, Dutch, Spaniards, Malays, Siamese, and Filipinos.
The Filipinos who were with Rizal were Mr. and Mrs. Salazar and Mr. Vicente Pardo.
Rizal attempted to converse in French, but to his surprise and embarrassment, he found out that his book on French, which he learned at Ateneo, could not be understood. He had to speak in mixed Spanish-Latin supplemented by gesticulations and sketching on paper. Later, he gradually improved his knowledge of the French language.
On May 17, 1882, Djemnah reached Point Galle, a seacoast town in southern Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He described the town as picturesque but lonely, quiet, and sad.
On May 18, 1882, Djemnah weighed anchor and resumed voyage towards Colombo, capital of Ceylon. Rizal was enamored by Colombo because of its scenic beauty and elegant buildings. He noted that it was more beautiful, smart, and elegant than Singapore, Point Galle and Manila.
