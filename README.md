## 📝 Project Description
**Noli Me Travel: Rizal’s Voyage from the Philippines to Spain** is an interactive 2D website-based map that visually presents and narrates the journey of Jose Rizal from the Philippines to Spain. The project highlights his stopovers and experiences in:
- Philippines  
- Singapore  
- Sri Lanka  
- Egypt  
- Italy  
- France  
- Spain  

Users can explore a hand-drawn map with clickable interactive elements such as ships, buildings, and landmarks. Clicking on these elements triggers overlay cards/dialogue boxes containing historical information, facts, and anecdotes about Rizal's experiences in each location.

A **sidebar timeline** displays the chronological sequence of Rizal’s travels. Each time a stopover is clicked, the corresponding point on the timeline is highlighted, allowing users to better visualize the unfolding of Rizal’s journey.

This project is inspired by the interactive website **[Pencilvania 🐕](https://pencilvania.stutpak.com/)**.
